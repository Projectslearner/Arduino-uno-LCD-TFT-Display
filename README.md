# Interfacing a TFT LCD Display with Arduino

## Description

This project demonstrates how to interface a TFT LCD display with an Arduino to display sensor readings. The setup includes initializing the TFT screen, displaying static text, and dynamically updating the screen with sensor values.

## Components Needed

1. **Arduino UNO**
2. **TFT LCD Display**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **Potentiometer (for contrast control, if necessary)**
5. **Breadboard**

## Instructions

### Connecting the Components

1. **TFT LCD to Arduino:**
   - Connect the TFT LCD pins to the Arduino as follows:
     - CS (Chip Select) to pin 10
     - DC (Data/Command) to pin 9
     - RST (Reset) to pin 8
   - Connect the VCC to 5V and GND to GND.
   - Connect other necessary pins (e.g., SCK, MOSI) according to your specific TFT module's requirements.

### Power the Arduino

- Connect the Arduino to your computer using a USB cable.

### Upload the Code and Observe the Data

1. **Load the Program:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE on your computer.
   - Write or paste the provided program into the IDE.
   - Select the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE under the Tools menu.
   - Upload the program to the Arduino.

2. **Monitor the Output:**
   - The TFT LCD will display "Sensor Value:" as static text.
   - The sensor reading from analog pin A0 will be displayed below it.
   - The sensor value will update every quarter second.

## Project Operation

- **Initialization:**
  - The TFT screen is initialized and set with a black background.
  - Static text "Sensor Value:" is displayed at the top.

- **Dynamic Sensor Value:**
  - The sensor value from pin A0 is read and converted to a string.
  - The sensor value is displayed below the static text.
  - The value updates every 250 milliseconds.
  - Previous sensor values are erased by overwriting them with a black background to prevent overlapping text.

## Applications

1. **Real-Time Monitoring:** Display real-time sensor data for various applications.
2. **User Interfaces:** Create dynamic user interfaces for projects requiring data visualization.
3. **Educational Tools:** Teach the basics of interfacing TFT LCDs with microcontrollers.
